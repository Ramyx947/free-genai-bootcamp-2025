# Romanian Sentence Constructor


## Business Goal:
A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Romanian. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.

*Will AI-Powered Assistants replace real teachers?*

## Technical Uncertainty

1. How well can an AI-Powered Assistant perform a very broad task?

 3. Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?
   
 5. Does using an AI-Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?
   
 7. How could we take the agent we built in an AI-Powered Assistant and reimplement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?
   
 9. How much do we have to rework our prompt documents from one AI-Powered Assistant to another?
    
 11. What prompting techniques can we naturally discover working in the confines of an AI-Powered Assistant?
    
 13. Are there any interesting innovations unique to specific AI-Powered Assistants for our business goal?
    
 15. What were we able to achieve based on our AI-Powered Assistant choice and our hardware, or budget limitations?
