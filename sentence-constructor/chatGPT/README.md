## Considerations:
I have the paid version of ChatGPT. GPT4o is fast enough, I don't want to use the o1 reasoning models because they have limit use per day.

Just like Meta AI there are no specific formatting to best provide context.

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Write Clear Instructions:
- Provide detailed, unambiguous queries.
- Specify desired formats, lengths, and levels of detail.

### Use Personas and Delimiters:
- Instruct the model to adopt specific tones or personas.
- Employ delimiters (e.g., triple quotes, XML tags) to structure input clearly.

### Break Down Complex Tasks:
- Split multifaceted tasks into simpler, manageable subtasks.
- Use step-by-step instructions to guide the model’s reasoning.

### Encourage “Chain-of-Thought” Reasoning:
- Ask the model to think through problems step-by-step before delivering a final answer.

### Incorporate Reference Texts:
- Provide trusted reference material to reduce factual errors and hallucinations.
- Include examples or citations when necessary.

### Leverage External Tools:
- Use code execution, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or function calls to enhance model performance on specific tasks.

### Systematically Evaluate Changes:
- Test prompt variations against a comprehensive set of examples or “gold-standard” answers to ensure improvements.

### Experiment and Iterate:
- Continuously refine prompts based on output quality and task-specific needs.
