# Why You Might Not Need Fine-Tuning with RAG

## Factual Accuracy
- **Prevents “hallucinations”:** RAG injects verified text from your knowledge base into the model’s prompt.  
- **Factual Q&A:** If your goal is mainly to answer factual questions (e.g., “What are the conjugations of a certain verb?”), RAG can do the heavy lifting without retraining the model.

## Topic Coverage
- **Leverage Relevant Snippets:** By retrieving knowledge snippets, the model can address domains it wasn’t specifically trained on—no fine-tuning needed.  
- **For Large, General LLMs:** Ideal for a high-capacity multilingual model that’s already fluent in a given language but needs domain-specific references (e.g., grammar guides, cultural notes).

## Rapid Prototyping
- **Quick to Implement:** RAG can be set up rapidly—no specialized data collection or training infrastructure is required.  
- **Off-the-Shelf Model:** Simply augment your existing model with a vector database of curated content, avoiding the complexity of a fine-tuning pipeline.

# Why You Might Still Want Fine-Tuning

## Consistent Style & Pedagogy
- **Uniform Teaching Style:** If your chatbot must consistently use a certain tone or follow strict grammar-checking procedures, a generic LLM might be unpredictable.  
- **Educational Scaffolding:** Fine-tuning “locks in” step-by-step grammar explanations and enforces formal/informal usage rules.

## Morphological Correctness (Especially for Romanian)
- **Complex Morphology:** Romanian has diacritics, formal/informal distinctions, and rich verb conjugations.  
- **Base Model Limitations:** RAG can supply grammar rules, but if the core model doesn’t grasp certain morphological patterns, generative text may contain errors.  
- **Fine-Tuning for Accuracy:** A carefully curated dataset helps the model reliably produce correct Romanian forms.

## Domain-Specific or Complex Tasks
- **Advanced Grammar Correction:** If you want robust grammar-checking, morphological tagging, or archaic form handling, fine-tuning can significantly boost performance over a generic LLM + RAG.

## Refining Behavior or Reducing Token Usage
- **Lower Reliance on Retrieval Prompts:** Fine-tuning can teach the model to handle certain responses natively, minimizing lengthy retrieval prompts.  
- **Concise, Focused Outputs:** Encourage succinct, direct answers at the model level.

## Handling Edge Cases
- **Fallback Strategies:** A general LLM with RAG might fail when encountering vague user input or slang outside the knowledge base.  
- **Reinforce Correct Responses:** Fine-tuning can help the model recover gracefully or default to known standards.

# Balanced Approach

1. **Start with RAG Alone:**  
   - Use a robust multilingual or Romanian-capable LLM.  
   - Test if it meets your accuracy and style needs.

2. **Evaluate Performance:**  
   - Check for repeated errors (morphological issues, inconsistent style, missing diacritics).

3. **Targeted Fine-Tuning:**  
   - If these errors persist, gather them and perform an instruction- or domain-focused fine-tune to correct the model’s behavior.

# Key Takeaway
- **RAG Alone**: Sufficient for stronger factual correctness and broader domain coverage.  
- **Fine-Tuning**: Optional, but can **significantly enhance fluency, style consistency, and advanced grammar handling**, which is especially relevant for a morphologically rich language like Romanian.
