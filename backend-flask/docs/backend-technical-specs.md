# Backend Server Technical Specifications

## Business Goal: 
A language learning school wants to build a prototype of learning portal which will act as three things:
- Inventory of possible vocabulary that can be learned
- Act as a  Learning record store (LRS), providing correct and wrong score on practice vocabulary
- A unified launchpad to launch different learning apps

You have been tasked with creating the backend API of the application.

## Technical Requirements:
- The backend will be written in Python
- The database will be SQLite3
- The API will be built using Flask
- The API will be JSON only
- There will be no authentication/authorization, 
- Everything will be treated as for a single user


## Database Schema

Our database will be a single user database called 'words.db' that will be created in the root of the project folder of the backend-flask.
We will use the following tables:

- `words`  - stored vocabulary words
    - `id` integer
    - `romanian`  string
    - `english` string
    - `parts` - json

- `words_groups` - joint table for words and groups - many -to -many
    - `id` integer
    - `word_id` integer
    - `group_id` integer
- `groups` - thematic groups of words
    - `id` integer
    - `name` string
- `study_sessions` - records of study sessions grouping `word_review_items`
    - `id` integer
    - `group_id`  integer
    - `created_at` datatime
    - `study_activity_id` integer
- `study_activities` - a specific study activity, linking a study session to group
    - `id` integer
    - `study_session_id` integer
    - `group_id` integer
    - `created_at` datatime
- `word_review_items`  a record of word practice, determining if the word was correct or not.
    - `word_id`  integer
    - `study_session_id` integer
    - `correct` boolean
    - `created_at` datatime

## Scripts (Tasks)

Invoke is the task runner for Python
### Initialize the database
This task will initialize the sqlite database called 'words.db'.

###  Migrate the database
This task will run a series of migrations sql files on the database.

Migrations live in the `migration` folder.
THe migration files will be run in order of their file name.
The file names should look like this:

```sql
001_init.sql
002_create_words_table.sql
```

###  Seed the database
This task will import JSON files and transform them into target data into the database.

All seed files live in the `seeds` folder
All seed files should be loaded.

In our task we should have a DSL to specify each seed files and its expected group word name.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "romanian": "mﾄビ",
    "english": "apple",
    "pronunciation": "mur",
},
```
